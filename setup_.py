# hello.py is a very simple 'Hello, world' type script which also displays the
# environment in which the script runs
#
# Run the build process by running the command 'python setup.py build'
#
# If everything works well you should find a subdirectory in the build
# subdirectory that contains the files needed to run the script without Python
